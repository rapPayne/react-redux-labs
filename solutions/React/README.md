# React Solutions

These are the solutions for React (not React Native) courses.

They will:
- be upgraded to React 19
- use TypeScript (?)
- use Zustand as the application state management
- use useActionState for forms
- use the use hook for async fetches
- use custom hooks for common tasks like fetching things
- use the CSS-per-component pattern

## Redux notes
The React 5-day class teaches Redux also. The 3-day version has only a "Redux in a nutshell" lecture/lab with and a bunch of pre-written Redux code.
